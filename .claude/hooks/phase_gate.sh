# Claude Code Stop hook: blocks ending a session in which no commit was made
# AND no tracker activity happened — the tracker is GitHub Issues (CLAUDE.md
# issue workflow): an issue created, commented, edited, or closed since the
# session started counts as recording the work.
#
# Uses .claude/.session-start-head + .claude/.session-start-time written by
# inject_phase_context.sh at SessionStart. Exit 2 blocks the stop once; a
# second stop attempt (with stop_hook_active=true) is allowed through so
# purely informational sessions can still end.
