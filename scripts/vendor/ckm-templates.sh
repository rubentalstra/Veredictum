# Vendor the official openEHR CKM template library as OPT 1.4 XML.
#
# Source: the public openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager REST API
# (https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/rest/v1). Every file is CKM's own
# Operational Template export, vendored verbatim with provenance.
#
# TWO PACKS, one script:
#
#   * the CURATED journey pack -> corpus/templates/ckm/<slug>.opt
#     Hand-picked, all COMPOSITION-rooted, each mapped to a role in the
#     measured-performance hospital-simulation journeys. The slugs are
#     REFERENCED BY NAME from corpus/MANIFEST.yaml, the journey definitions
#     and scripts/generate-ckm-examples.sh — never rename or drop one.
#
#   * the FULL library -> corpus/templates/ckm/full/<slug>.opt
#     Every template CKM publishes (slug derived from the display name),
#     for breadth gates over the OPT 1.4 reader / WebTemplate builder.
#
# CKM REST PAGINATION GOTCHA (cost an afternoon once — do not relearn it):
# the list endpoints page with `?page=N&size=M`. `limit`, `pageSize`,
# `maxResults`, `offset`, `count`, `rows` are all silently IGNORED and you
# get a 20-row first page, which reads exactly like "CKM only publishes 20
# templates". Always page with page/size, and assert the count grew.
#
# Some CKM resources live in a private incubator and 404 without an account;
# those are recorded as unreachable in the provenance file rather than
# silently skipped.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/vendor/ckm-templates.sh              # curated pack + full library
#   scripts/vendor/ckm-templates.sh --curated    # curated pack only
#   scripts/vendor/ckm-templates.sh --full       # full library only
#   CKM_JOBS=8 scripts/vendor/ckm-templates.sh   # parallel fetches (default 4)
#
# Example skeletons (`*.example.json`) for the curated pack are generated
# separately against the composed SUT by scripts/generate-ckm-examples.sh.
