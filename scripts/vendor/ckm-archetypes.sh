# Vendor the official openEHR CKM archetype library — the ADL 1.4 half of the
# two-dialect archetype corpus.
#
# Source: the public openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager REST API
# (https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/rest/v1). Each file is CKM's own export,
# vendored verbatim with provenance.
#
# WHICH DIALECT CKM SERVES (verified 2026-08-01 — do not re-guess):
#   * `GET /archetypes/{cid}/adl` -> ADL **1.4** text (`adl_version=1.4` in the
#     archetype header). This is the ONLY ADL CKM publishes.
#   * `GET /archetypes/{cid}/xml` -> the AM 1.4 ARCHETYPE XML of the same
#     archetype (opt-in here via --with-xml; roughly +40% bytes).
#   * There is NO ADL 2 export: `/adl2`, `/adl14`, `/adl2.4`, `/opt2` and
#     `/source` all 404, and `?format=ADL2` / `?version=2` are silently
#     ignored (byte-identical 1.4 response). The ADL 2.4 corpus therefore
#     comes from a DIFFERENT official source —
#     `scripts/vendor/adl2-archetypes.sh` (openEHR/adl-archetypes).
#     Never present a CKM export as ADL 2, and never fill the ADL 2 side by
#     running our own 1.4->2 converter over CKM output: that would test the
#     converter against itself.
#
# CKM REST PAGINATION GOTCHA: the list endpoints page with `?page=N&size=M`.
# `limit`, `pageSize`, `maxResults`, `offset`, `count` and `rows` are all
# silently IGNORED and you get a 20-row first page — which reads exactly like
# "CKM only publishes 20 archetypes". Always page with page/size and assert
# the count grew.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/vendor/ckm-archetypes.sh                # ADL 1.4 texts
#   scripts/vendor/ckm-archetypes.sh --with-xml     # + the AM 1.4 XML twin
#   CKM_JOBS=8 scripts/vendor/ckm-archetypes.sh     # parallel (default 4)
