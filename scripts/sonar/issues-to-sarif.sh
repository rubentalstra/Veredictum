# Exports a SonarQube Cloud project's OPEN and CONFIRMED findings as SARIF
# 2.1.0, so `sonar.yml` can upload them to GitHub code scanning (#543).
# SonarQube Cloud's own GitHub integration is checks and pull-request
# decoration only — nothing on their side uploads SARIF, which is the only
# thing the code-scanning tools page lists.
#
# The query excludes ACCEPTED and FALSE_POSITIVE on purpose: a disposition
# recorded in the dashboard (the ai-code-review.md law) disappears from the
# next upload, and code scanning then closes the alert — the two surfaces
# cannot disagree for longer than one analysis.
#
# Usage: issues-to-sarif.sh <project-key> <output.sarif>
# Reads SONAR_TOKEN from the environment. When the scanner's
# .scannerwork/report-task.txt is present, waits for that analysis' compute
# task first, so the export reads the run's own result rather than the
# previous one.
