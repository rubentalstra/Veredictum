# The hosted box's deploy script is real shell, and it is linted like real shell
# (#423).
#
# WHY IT NEEDS A GUARD AT ALL. `deploy.sh` lives inside `cloud-init.yaml` as a
# `write_files` content block, which is where shellcheck never looks: the file
# is YAML, and no Rust test, no rustfmt run and no actionlint pass reads a
# string inside it. It is also the ONE command the CI deploy key may run, so a
# defect there is a box that stops taking deploys — the failure mode with the
# most expensive recovery on this host, because the fix has to be typed over
# SSH.
#
# So the block is extracted to a real file and linted. The extraction is also
# the check: a `write_files` entry that stops writing `deploy.sh`, or a block
# that stops being a bash script, fails here.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT check: that a real deploy works. Only a deploy
# proves that, and `deploy/hosted/README.md` says which properties only a
# deploy can show.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/checks/hosted-deploy-script.sh
#   scripts/checks/hosted-deploy-script.sh --self-test
