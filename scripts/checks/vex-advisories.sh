# The VEX drift gate: the published OpenVEX document must be exactly what the
# generator produces from `deny.toml` + `security/vex/rust-advisories.toml`.
#
# Two failure modes it exists to catch:
#
#   1. An advisory is accepted in `deny.toml` and no justification is published,
#      so a downstream scanner sees an unexplained finding while the argument
#      sits in a TOML comment nobody downstream reads. (The generator refuses;
#      this gate is where that refusal reaches CI.)
#   2. The JSON is hand-edited, or the prose changes without regeneration, and
#      the published document quietly stops matching the gate it claims to
#      describe.
#
# What this gate CANNOT see: whether either side still describes reality. An
# ignore and its justification agree perfectly right up until a dependency
# upgrade resolves the advisory, at which point both are stale and both still
# pass here. deny.toml's DELETING-EVENT rule is that half, re-checked at every
# dependency-bump cycle.
