# Render `.zenodo.json` from `CITATION.cff` (#2210).
#
# Zenodo's own rule makes this file necessary and dangerous in one sentence:
# "If your repository contains both a .zenodo.json and a CITATION.cff file,
# Zenodo will only use the .zenodo.json metadata. The CITATION.cff will be
# COMPLETELY IGNORED for the GitHub release archiving."
# (https://help.zenodo.org/docs/github/describe-software/zenodo-json/)
#
# A hand-written copy would therefore silently disable the file CI already
# guards, and the two would drift with no signal — the deposit saying one thing
# while the citation box says another, under a DOI nobody can correct. So this
# file is GENERATED: CITATION.cff stays the single source for every fact both
# carry, and `citation-guard` runs this script in --check mode.
#
# The output is the FLAT LEGACY DEPOSIT shape the help page documents — not
# the InvenioRDM record shape this script previously emitted. Measured
# first-hand on this repository's own first GitHub-archived deposit
# (10.5281/zenodo.21940280, v3.17.6, read 2026-08-15): the record-shape file
# was IGNORED entirely and the deposit fell back to GitHub's raw repo
# metadata (title "rubentalstra/FerroEHR: v3.17.6", the full 29-name
# contributor list as creators), refuting the earlier claim that the
# integration accepts the record shape. The help page's complete example
# (read 2026-08-15) is the authority for the field spellings used below:
# flat top-level keys, `license` as a lowercase id, camelCase
# `related_identifiers[].relation`, creators as {name, orcid, affiliation}.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/render/zenodo-json.sh            # write .zenodo.json
#   scripts/render/zenodo-json.sh --check    # fail if the committed file is stale
