# scripts/gh/rel.sh — the deterministic GitHub issue-relationship helper.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: `gh` has NO native subcommand for sub-issues or issue
# dependencies (verified against gh 2.88.1), so relationships can only be set
# through `gh api`. Worse, every WRITE endpoint takes the target issue's
# DATABASE id, not its #number — a foot-gun that makes hand-typed `gh api`
# calls easy to get wrong. This wrapper resolves #number -> database id for
# you and calls the one correct endpoint, so every relationship command is
# consistent, typed correctly, and fails loud on a bad number.
#
# Reads are #number-keyed and need no id resolution; writes go through here.
#
# Official docs (durable references — the ONLY citations allowed for this):
#   Sub-issues API ...... https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/sub-issues
#   Dependencies API .... https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issue-dependencies
#   Sub-issues (concept)  https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/adding-sub-issues
#   Dependencies (concept) https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-issue-dependencies
#
# Policy — WHEN to use each relationship: .claude/rules/issue-relationships.md
#
# Ported from FerroEHR at the Veredictum split (FerroEHR#2789) with the body
# unchanged: it resolves the repository from `gh repo view`, so it is
# repository-agnostic by construction and there was nothing to adapt but the
# licensing header. Verified live against rubentalstra/Veredictum on the port.
#
# Limits (from the docs above): <=100 sub-issues per parent, <=8 nesting
# levels, one parent per issue (use --replace to move it); <=50 issues per
# dependency direction.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gh/rel.sh parent     <child> <parent> [--replace]  # child -> sub-issue of parent
#   scripts/gh/rel.sh unparent   <child>                       # detach child from its parent
#   scripts/gh/rel.sh blocked-by <n> <blocker>                # n is blocked by blocker
#   scripts/gh/rel.sh unblock    <n> <blocker>                # remove "n blocked-by blocker"
#   scripts/gh/rel.sh blocking   <n> <blocked>                # n blocks blocked
#   scripts/gh/rel.sh unblocking <n> <blocked>                # remove "n blocking blocked"
#   scripts/gh/rel.sh tree       <n>                          # print every relationship of n
#   scripts/gh/rel.sh id         <n>                          # print the database id of n
#
# All commands act on the current repository (`gh repo view`).
