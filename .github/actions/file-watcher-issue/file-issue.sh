# The scheduled lanes' filing engine — ONE dedup search and ONE file-or-comment
# loop, so a second lane cannot arrive with its own dedup idiom and its own label
# convention. Ported from FerroEHR, where six lanes had grown three dedup idioms
# and four label conventions between them, and one of them silently SKIPPED an
# existing issue instead of commenting on it, so a recurring finding was reported
# once and then never again.
#
# Callers: the sibling `action.yml`, the workflow-facing interface, used by
# `image-scan.yml` and `latest-deps.yml`. The engine lives in the action
# directory because the action must be self-contained — a composite resolves its
# own files through `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH`
# (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/metadata-syntax#runsstepsrun)
# — so a lane that files N issues per run reaches into it rather than the
# reverse.
#
# RUN COLOUR. This engine only runs after a probe has produced an answer, so
# reaching it is never a failure: it exits 0 for every outcome (created,
# commented, updated, skipped, none) and non-zero only when its own `gh` call
# fails, which is a broken filing path rather than a finding. A probe that
# cannot answer — transport error, tool crash, unparseable output — fails in the
# probe step and never gets here. That is the uniform rule for every scheduled
# lane here: the run is RED only when the PROBE fails; a finding files or updates
# an issue and the run stays GREEN, because the issue is the alert. A red
# scheduled run is invisible to anyone not watching the Actions tab.
#
# DEDUP MATCH RULE. GitHub's `in:title "phrase"` is a phrase search, not an
# exact-title match, so the search alone can return a title that merely CONTAINS
# the phrase. Both modes therefore post-filter the search result:
#
#   * default (no `--dedup-key`) — the title IS the key: a match is an issue
#     whose title is byte-equal. Keep the title constant across runs (a run
#     number, date or version in it would open a new issue every run) and put
#     the varying detail in the body.
#   * `--dedup-key K` (repeatable) — the key is a token that must appear in the
#     title: a match is an issue whose title contains EVERY key,
#     case-insensitively. This is what the spec watchers need, where the Jira
#     key or the component-plus-version pair identifies the work and the rest of
#     the title is free text.
#
# BODY BY FILE ONLY. Watcher bodies carry remote content — upstream release
# notes, scanner output, third-party server messages — which must never be
# parsed as script or as a flag.
#
# Usage:
#   file-issue.sh file --title T --body-file F [--labels a,b] [--dedup-key K]...
#                      [--state open|all] [--on-existing comment|update|skip]
#                      [--repo R] [--dry-run]
#   file-issue.sh find [--title T] [--dedup-key K]... [--state open|all] [--repo R]
#
# `file` prints one `file-issue: <outcome> …` line and, when `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` is
# set, writes `issue=` and `outcome=` to it. `find` prints the matching issue
# number, or nothing.
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN (or GITHUB_TOKEN) for gh · GITHUB_REPOSITORY as the `--repo`
# default · GITHUB_OUTPUT to receive the outputs.
