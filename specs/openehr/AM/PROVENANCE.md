# Vendored openEHR spec docs: AM

- Source: https://github.com/openEHR/specifications-AM
- Ref: master (AM 2.4.0 + ADL/AOM/OPT 1.4)
- Commit: `da06d63297e8549a351c854d8b1c45cd9f1d577c`
- Vendored by: `scripts/vendor-spec-docs.sh` (text formats only: adoc md txt csv json yaml yml robot xml opt g4)
- Plus the 27 UML class-diagram SVG(s) under `docs/UML/diagrams/` that
  the vendored chapters reference as `image::{uml_diagrams_uri}/<name>.svg`,
  taken from the same pinned commit. Referenced files only — the upstream
  diagram directory is not mirrored wholesale.
- Plus the 44 per-document figure(s) under
  `docs/<doc_name>/diagrams/` and `docs/<doc_name>/images/` that the vendored
  chapters reference as `image::{diagrams_uri}/<name>` /
  `image::{images_uri}/<name>`, taken byte-for-byte from the same pinned
  commit. Referenced files only — the upstream figure directories are not
  mirrored wholesale.
- Unreferenced figures, UML `.xmi`/`.mdzip`, XSDs and other binaries
  excluded — fetch from the repo at the pinned commit.

Do not hand-edit files under this directory; re-run the script instead.
